{"post":{"title":"Python 3.7.0b4, final 3.7 beta, now available for testing","content":"Python 3.7.0b4 is the final beta preview of Python 3.7, the next feature release of Python. Beta releases are intended to give you the opportunity to test new features and bug fixes and to prepare your projects to support the new feature release. We strongly encourage you to test your projects with 3.7 during the beta phase and report issues found to bugs.python.org as soon as possible. While the release is feature complete entering the beta phase, it is possible that features may be modified or, in rare cases, deleted up until the start of the release candidate phase.  Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and its use is not recommended for production environments.  Attention macOS users: there is now a new installer variant for macOS 10.9+ that includes a built-in version of Tcl/Tk 8.6. This variant is expected to become the default version when 3.7.0 releases.  Check it out! The next preview release will be the release candidate and is planned for 2018-05-21 followed by the official release of 3.7.0, planned for 2018-06-15. You can find Python 3.7.0b4 and more information here."}}
